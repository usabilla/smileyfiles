Git
===

It's git! That glorious and sometimes enigmatic tool that you work with on a daily basis.

The key to a good git experience is a good `.gitconfig`. We've added a `.gitconfig` here with lots of goodies. Check it out and read the descriptions.

We've also added a `.gitignore` that, once stowed, will be your global gitignore that applies to all projects. Your global gitignore should contain ignores that are specific to your environment and might not be considered in a project's gitignore. The gitignore we've made was compiled from github's global gitignore templates which can be found here: <https://github.com/github/gitignore/tree/master/Global>
